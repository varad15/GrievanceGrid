# GrievanceGrid

## Project Overview

**GrievanceGrid** is a comprehensive, next-generation Smart Municipal Dashboard designed to streamline the handling, routing, and resolution of urban grievances for cities and municipal corporations.

Our platform leverages advanced machine learning, workflow automation, and real-time analytics to ensure every citizen complaint is categorized, assigned, tracked, and resolved efficiently‚Äîacross staff, department heads, and administrators.

## Key Features

### üöÄ Intelligent Complaint Management
- **Multi-issue Parsing:** Citizens can submit paragraphs containing multiple problems in any language or mix; the system automatically detects, splits, and treats each as a distinct complaint.
- **AI-powered Classification:** Each sub-complaint is auto-classified by category and department, and mapped to real municipal department IDs and offices using the organization‚Äôs schema.

### üõ†Ô∏è Automated Assignment & Resolution Workflow
- **Smart Routing:** Issues are instantly assigned to the right department, ward, or office, reducing manual triage time.
- **Pipeline Tracking:** View every action from submission to closure, including staff assignments, status changes, and audit trails.

### ‚è´ Escalation Engine
- **SLA Enforcement:** Every complaint is linked to a multi-level escalation ladder defined in the schema, ensuring timely action by the responsible officers.
- **Automatic Escalation:** Complaints overdue beyond SLA auto-escalate through the officer/head/exec hierarchy, with all deadlines, ladders, and officers mapped from the database.
- **Visual Alerts:** Real-time dashboard highlights complaints ‚Äúat risk‚Äù or overdue for escalation.

### üìä Analytics & Visualization
- **Category/Department Heatmaps:** See complaint activity, track resolution, and identify bottlenecks.
- **Geographical Insights:** Map-based and tabular analysis of areas/wards with maximum complaints and delayed issues.
- **Aging & Priority Dashboards:** Full breakdown of complaints by status, urgency, and department.

### üîí Role-based Access
- **Civic Portal:** Citizens can submit and track complaints.
- **Staff & Department Head Dashboard:** See, action, and escalate assigned grievances.
- **Admin Suite:** Full cross-department and citywide controls with analytics.

### üåç Modern Tech Stack
